# OffChat  
**A decentralized, off-grid chat system for secure peer-to-peer communication**  

OffChat is an experimental **offline-first chat system** designed to enable **communication without relying on centralized servers or the internet**.  
It is built with **resilience, security, and portability** in mind, making it useful in scenarios such as:  
- Internet blackouts  
- Disaster recovery  
- Privacy-conscious communication  
- Off-grid exploration

## ✨ Features  
- 📡 **Off-Grid Communication** – No centralized server required.  
- 🔒 **End-to-End Encryption** – Messages remain secure and private.  
- 🌐 **Peer-to-Peer Networking** – Nodes discover and communicate directly.  
- 🛠️ **Cross-Platform** – Works across Linux, Windows, and macOS.  
- ⚡ **Lightweight** – Minimal resource usage for maximum efficiency.  
- 🔌 **Modular Design** – Easy to extend with plugins (transport, UI, encryption).

# Project Roadmap

## Version 1
- Multi-client chat server over Wi-Fi.

## Version 2
- Introduce unique user IDs / usernames.  
- Support private (one-to-one) messaging.

## Version 3
- Transition from Raspberry Pi to ESP8266/NodeMCU.  
- Establish lightweight TCP/IP Wi-Fi networking.

## Version 4
- Replace Wi-Fi transport with **LoRa**.  
- Optimize for lower bandwidth and longer communication range.

## Version 5
- Implement **mesh/static routing**.  
- Enable message relaying (multi-hop communication) across nodes.
